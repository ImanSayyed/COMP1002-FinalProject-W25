        <h2>A Walkman? In this day and age?</h2>
        <p>Well Yes, Some people love playing songs on their phones, but there are a lot of reasons why some people might want a portable music player in the modern era.</p> Streaming burns through a lot of data and battery life, and downloaded songs can take up a lot of storage space. Perhaps you're regularly away from Wi-Fi or cellular signals, like on a plane or subway. </p>Do you have unlimited data when you're traveling? Maybe a young or older family member wants tunes, but doesn't need the complexities of a phone.</p>
