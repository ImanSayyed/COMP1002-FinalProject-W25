            <h1>About Sony Walkman</h1>
            <p>The Sony Walkman revolutionized portable music in 1979, allowing users to enjoy their favorite tunes anywhere. Developed by Sony, this compact cassette player became an iconic symbol of the 80s and 90s.</p>
            <p>It enabled people to create soundtracks to their lives in ways that hadn't been possible before. The fact that you could use your Walkman anywhere changed that; music had never been so personal.</p>
            <p>It was the first in a long line of portable audio players, and without it, we might not have the same objects such as iPods and MP3 players that we do today.</p>
